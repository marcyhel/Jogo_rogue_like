All files that are or will be contained in the free starter pack are meant to be used to follow Chosenplay Game Development tutorials 
at: "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEq7B81g9WmbhXLJeu2uACw" but are yours to use for either free or paid projects with 
no additional cost unless stated otherwise. 

The only requirement is that you credit me (Luca Leonardi of Chosenplay) as the creator of the assets :)

To be notified on upgrades to the pack you can join our discord channel by using this link: https://discord.gg/dDY8m8C

As a last note if you ever find an error or a mistake inside the pack itself 
(such as missing pixels or tiles not lining up or anything else) please do not hesitate in letting me know so I can make it better 
in future releases :)

Enjoy!

Luca
